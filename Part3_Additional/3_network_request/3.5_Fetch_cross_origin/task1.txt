Why Origin is needed, if Referer has even more information?

    Referer may leak sensitive info in the URL 
    Origin hides all that. It only tells what site the request came from.

Is it possible that thereâ€™s no Referer or Origin, or is it incorrect?

    Yes, it is possible for both Referer and Origin to be missing
